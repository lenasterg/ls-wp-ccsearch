# Easy search and use CC-licensed images for WP 

Easy search and use CC-licensed images for WP helps you search millions of CC-licensed images without leaving WordPress editor and use one into your post content or set as featured image very quickly.

You can download the final stable version via the WordPress.org repository at https://wordpress.org/plugins/ls-wp-ccsearch/


## Description
Easy search and use CC-licensed images for WP helps you search millions of free photos using the [Openverse API](https://api.openverse.engineering/v1/) then insert the original image into content or set as featured image very quickly.
It allows the user to filter the provider source.
The plugin is inspired and based on the [CCSearch] (https://ccsearch.creativecommons.org/) and it wouldnt't be possible without the  [Openverse API](https://api.openverse.engineering/v1/)  and until version 2.0 the  [Creative Commons Catalog API](https://api.creativecommons.engineering).

After the plugin's activation, you can see the "Image with CC License"  button above the editor and as option into the "Add Media" pop-up window. 
By pressing it  you can search using Latin characters for an image, browse the returned images, preview an image and its license and adjust the image settings: 
 - use of thumbnail or original image,
 - set the image link (if any). 
 - Insert the image into the post or as featured image.

NOTE: Please, verify the license at the source. CC Search aggregates data from publicly available repositories of open content. 
Creative Commons does not host the content and does not verify that the content is properly CC-licensed or that the attribution information is accurate or complete. 
Please follow the link to the source of the content to independently verify before reuse.

Currently, the plugin needs Classic Editor (https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) in order to work.
